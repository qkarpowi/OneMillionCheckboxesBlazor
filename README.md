# One Million Checkboxes
This is an effort to recreate the one million checkbox project by eieio but in c# using the asp.net framework and blazor features I don't often get to work with. I threw this together in less than a week so it still needs optimization. Something I want to add in the future is redis. Currently the checkbox state is kept in memory and will reset on restart.
